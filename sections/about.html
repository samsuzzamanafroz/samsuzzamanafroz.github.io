                <p>
                    I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, 
                    where my research focuses on fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology using 
                    gravitational-wave observations. My work lies at the interface of theory, data analysis, 
                    and statistical inference, with a strong emphasis on extracting robust physical constraints 
                    from complex and noisy datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research includes cosmological parameter estimation, tests of gravity 
                    in both the weak- and strong-field regimes, and studies of the astrophysical population of 
                    compact binary mergers, particularly binary black holes. I work with data from current and 
                    future gravitational-wave detectors, including LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA, LISA, Cosmic Explorer, 
                    and the Einstein Telescope, and combine these with electromagnetic cosmological probes such 
                    as DESI and the Pantheon supernova sample.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Methodologically, I develop and apply advanced Bayesian inference techniques, including 
                    hierarchical modeling and likelihood-based analyses, to high-dimensional observational data. 
                    As a member of the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration, I contribute to gravitational-wave data 
                    analysis and cosmological inference efforts within large international collaborations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More broadly, my work is motivated by the use of rigorous statistical methods to address 
                    fundamental questions in physics and cosmology, and I am interested in extending these 
                    quantitative approaches to a wide range of data-intensive scientific problems.
